## Project Proposal - New York MTA Turnstile Data
  The WomenTechWomenYes organization aims to increase the number of members in the organizationâ€™s database. They want their street teams to collect as many individual email addresses as possible before their annual gala. The purpose of the project is to allocate the street teams in New York so that they can reach the maximum number of people. In order to this, I will explore the MTA data and find the busiest 
  
* MTA turnpike
* month of the year
* day of the week
* time of the day.

The database that will be used is MTA turnstile data, about the patterns of transit traffic in New York City between February, 2019 and June 2019 - to eliminate the effect Covid 19 pandemic on public transit. The variable of interest will be the entry and exit of the on-foot traffic, i.e. ENTRIES, the cumulative entry register value for a device, and EXIST, the cumulative exit register value. All initial exploratory data analysis will be done on Jupyter notebook with the help of pandas, SQLAlchemy and numpy. In addition,  Matplotlib and seaborn will be used for the visual summary.
